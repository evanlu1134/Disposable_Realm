## :memo: Summary
Littering is a common occurrence throughout public streets and areas. It results in
the visual decay of our communities, attracting pests, and can be hazardous to live
in. In Brooklyn, trash is everywhere with ‚Äúsubway riders‚Ä¶tossing candy wrappers
and soda cans on the sidewalk‚Ä¶‚Äù (Berger, 2011), leaving business owners susceptible
to city fines and contributing to the litter problem affecting communities,
neighborhoods, and quality of life.

According to a research study conducted by Keep America Beautiful (KAB), ‚Äù 15% of
the variance in littering behavior results from contextual constraints (e.g.,
insufficient number of receptacles, existing litter on the ground), while the
remainder results from the individual (e.g., lack of motivation)‚Äú(KAB, 2009).
Existing litter combined with a lack of motivation results in an expected behavior
of individuals not correctly disposing of and contributing to existing litter. This
domino effect will never end until we start acting and being conscious about
reducing litter around our community. These day-to-day observations of trash and
waste piling bring dismay and deterioration, seeing them with our eyes. Thus,
solutions like informing the users about recycling, litter stop signs, and fines
are not enough.

## :disappointed: The Problem
Brooklyn has tried to solve the street littering problem through fines, signs, and even by eliminating litter
baskets from city streets. However, none of these solutions have helped the problem; however, Brooklyn streets
continue to be filled with garbage. Additionally, these solutions to the Brooklyn litter problem cause more
problems like increased garbage or are unrealistic due to the needed manpower to enforce rules and regulations
around fines.

## :blush: Our Solution
Disposing Realm targets user motivation by incentivizing users to pick up litter in Brooklyn streets and public
areas while earning points. The application promotes action every time users upload an image or video of them
cleaning up streets by mimicking a game experience that leads to rewards. Users can challenge one another to
remove as much litter as possible, comment on posts, and earn badges for their efforts.

## üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Key Technical Challenge
Technical challenges are implementing an item-based point system feature that awards different numbers of points
for different types of litter, verifying posts and litter removal, finding a map API that shows Brooklyn
neighborhood by litter concentration, and authorization for JWT in the backend connecting to the front end with
REACT.
___
## +++ Extension Opportunities
Implementing a leaderboard for tracking achieving goals or milestones, integration across other applications,
adding a friend system, and requesting a litter basket.
